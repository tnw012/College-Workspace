Pan Fried Sea Bass with Lemon Garlic Herb Sauce
Ingredients : 
3 tablespoons butter divided
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1.5 lbs. sea bass such as barramundi
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more if needed
1/2 teaspoon black pepper plus more if needed
2 cloves garlic minced
1/4 cup dry white wine such as savignon blanc
1/2 cup chicken stock/broth or water, in a pinch
juice of one lemon about 2 tablespoons
1 tablespoon fresh oregano roughly chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme roughly chopped
tablespoon fresh parsley roughly chopped
lemon wedges for serving optional

Instructions: 
1. Pat the fish dry with a paper towel.

2. In a shallow dish, mix together the flour (1/4
cup), salt (1 teaspoon), and black pepper (1/2
teaspoon).

3. Dredge each piece of fish in the flour mixture,
coating the entire surface, and shake off any
excess.

4. In a large skillet, preferably stainless steel or
nonstick, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over
medium high heat and add the olive oil (1
tablespoon).

5. Cook the fish in the skillet for 3-4 minutes on
each side, until golden brown and fully cooked.
Try not to move the fish too much, especially if
you are using a pan that isn’t nonstick, otherwise
the fish may be more likely to stick to the bottom
and not get browned as nicely.

6. Remove fish from the skillet to a plate.

7. Turn down the heat to low. Add the white wine (1/4
cup) to the skillet to deglaze, stirring up any
browned bits. Continue heating until almost all
the wine has evaporated.

8. Add one more tablespoon of butter to the skillet.
Once it’s melted, add the minced garlic (2 cloves)
and fresh herbs (1 tablespoon each of oregano,
thyme, and parsley) to the skillet and sauté until
fragrant, about 30 seconds.

9. Add the chicken broth (1/2 cup) and bring to a
simmer. If sauce seems very thin, continue
simmering until reduced and thicker to your
liking.Turn off heat and stir in remaining 1
tablespoon butter and lemon juice (about 2
tablespoons). Taste and adjust seasoning if
necessary.

10. Serve sauce on top of fish.

preferred) on high heat. Add the olive oil.
Pan-fry the salmon, skin side down first, for
about 1 minute. Turn the salmon over and cook for
1 minute. Turn it over again so the skin side is
at the bottom.

4. Add the garlic into the pan, saute until slightly
browned. Add the honey mixture and lemon wedges
into the skillet, reduce the sauce until it's
sticky.

5. Finish it off by broiling the salmon in the oven
